To keep us updated with the technology, I propose to do something that we can learn.
Idea is, begin with a small step, 
1. create a web application where we can capture our information, name phone number, address..
2. next step integrate this info with facebook api (we can then pull other infos), link address to point in google map (use google APIs)
3. host the web app on amazon EC2
4. create a mobile app for access this info
see attached file for technology
(my proposal)
html5
MongoDB (Pavan wanted MySQL)
Tomcat (or ngix or equinox)
For step 1, use one of our desktop that is in office or Jpaas
git hub and jenkins
Next steps:
Interested people please respond lets have a smaller discussion and tasks/team divisions
